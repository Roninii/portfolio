Wow, so.. It's been a while.

A _long_ while.. like 4 years. That's basically like starting over. When I started this blog, I don't think I really had a purpose, per se. I was somewhere between wanting to "learn in public", wanting to solidify my knowledge on things as I learned them, and to be honest, I think one of the major factors was just hoping that it helped me find that "dream job" some time in the future.

Needless to say, those really aren't the best reasons, or rather, just not the best reasons for me. By the state of this blog, and by state, I mean practically abandoned, it's clear to see that I wasn't deeply motivated by those reasons.

So.. what _does_ motivate me?

- I genuinely do _enjoy_ writing. I kind of always have. I wrote short stories and many abandoned novels as a young kid, I wrote songs in high school, and I still write a fair amount of various notes and journal.
- I enjoy _helping_ people. Cheesy, yeah, but accurate. I do really enjoy helping others solve issues and I would _love_ if my posts helped even just one or two people. This one is dangerous though, and it's easy to let that desire to help others become an external force that adds artificial pressure to what you do. No burn out here, please.
- I want a reason to learn new things. I have always worked full time _somewhere_ since the start of my dev career, and while I have learned, and continue to learn, **a lot**, there is eventaully a point where that learning slows down. This gives me a creative outlet; a _reason_ to learn new things - so that it can be shared.

So, with that said, let's start over, shall we?

Hi, I'm Ronnie. I'm currently a Senior Software Engineer at GreyNoise Intelligence. I'm a T-Shaped developer, with a focus on the frontend. I'm also a gamer, a former vocalist, the occasional artist, and a deeply curious person.

As for the content you'll find here, I'm not 100% sure yet! I've been working on a small side project here and there that I plan to launch and talk about here soon, so that'll probably be the first post you see. I have also been drinking the [Zed](https://zed.dev) kool-aid, and I'm very interested in talking about that as well (including a bit about why I'm taking this as an opportunity to also learn Vim via it's Vim mode?). I have a few other ideas as well, but that could end up like my massive backlog of Steam games so who knows. I may even occasionally do non-code related stuff, depending on how things go. Probably best to put that elsewhere, but hey, it's my blog right?

Anyways, I hope that you find something of value here, and if you do, I hope that you'll let me know!

Until next time. Cya nerds. üëãüèª
